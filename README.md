# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose of this Analysis
PyBer's CEO has requested a summary and visualization of the ride data by city type to identify any disparities in rural, suburban, and urban usage. By identifying these disparities, we can provide a business proposal to improve the efficacy and participants in the system. 

## Ride-Sharing Data

### Average Cost by City Type

There is a significant disparity in the number of rides and drivers between the three city types. 
- Urban areas have the most rides taken but nearly twice the number of drivers, significantly reducing the money to be made per driver. 
- There is a decent balance between the number of rides taken and drivers available in the suburban area.
- Rural areas have a significant number of rides in comparison to the number of drivers, creating higher payouts for drivers due to supply and demand imbalance.

### Trends by City Type

There is not a significant disparity between frequency trends for the three city types over the course of January to May. This is likely due to spring weather cycles affecting all three city types on a fairly equal distribution. We see an increase in usage across all types for the last week of February, for instance, and then again the first week of April. 

## Summary

### Summary of Data
- The most rides requested are found in urban areas. This can likely be attributed to both a high population density as well as low parking availability.
- The best balance between supply and demand can be found in suburban areas where the gap is not as significant in one direction or the other.
- Rural areas have low supply and demand, likely due to low population density as well as the expense of traveling longer distances to get to the selected destination.

### Business Recommendations
PyBer's CEO has requested three business recommendations to address the disparities found between the city types. 
- Create an incentive for drivers willing to take longer drives (commutes, etc) within urban areas to increase their average pay per trip. 
- Initiate a marketing campaign including discounts for riders for events within urban areas to increase ride requests and maximize the usage of available drivers.
- Offer specialized transportation options for rural areas by contracting with communities or schools to assist with basic transportation during school events or religious services.
